# Array Manipulation Functions

This repository contains JavaScript functions for manipulating an array of data objects representing individuals. These functions are designed to be executed via buttons in an HTML interface. 


## Functions

### 1. Print Developers (`PrintDeveloper` function)

This function logs all developers from the array to the console.

### 2. Add Data (`addData` function)

`addData` allows you to add a new data object to the array. It collects details such as name, age, and profession from user prompts and appends the new object to the array.

### 3. Remove Admins (`removeAdmin` function)

`removeAdmin` extracts and removes all objects with the "admin" profession from the array.

### 4. Concatenate Array (`concatenateArray` function)

`concatenateArray` demonstrates how to combine two arrays. In this example, a dummy array is created, and both arrays are concatenated. The result is logged to the console.

### 5. Average Age (`averageAge` function)

This function calculates and logs the average age of all individuals in the array.

### 6. Age Check (`checkAgeAbove25` function)

`checkAgeAbove25` checks if there is at least one person in the array who is older than 25 and logs the result.

### 7. Unique Professions (`uniqueProfessions` function)

`uniqueProfessions` logs all distinct professions present in the array.

### 8. Sort by Age (`sortByAge` function)

`sortByAge` organizes the array by age in ascending order and logs the sorted array.

### 9. Update Profession (`updateJohnsProfession` function)

This function updates 'john's profession to 'manager' in the array.

### 10. Profession Count (`getTotalProfessions` function)

`getTotalProfessions` calculates and prints the total number of developers and admins in the array.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see buttons corresponding to each of the above functions.

3. Click on the buttons to execute the functions and observe the results in the browser console.

Feel free to explore the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file to understand how each function is implemented.

Enjoy experimenting with these array manipulation functions!
